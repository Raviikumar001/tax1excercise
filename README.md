# tax1excercise

Production live link: https://tax1excercise.vercel.app

Tests as run with cypress, Node should be installed for that to run.

To run tests locally: 

Inside the test folder, the cypress config file contains the base URL which is used for testing, I have set it to the production link,

if you're running the project locally, do include the localhost URL instead of the production url. 

```
cd test
npm install
npx cypress open
```
